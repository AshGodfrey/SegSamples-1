Clicking "copy" will copy the sample call directly to your keyboard. Clicking 'payload' will copy the payload for that sample call.

You can use copy to automatically copy that call to your clipboard. 

### Search Feature ###

The search feature searches for a key word or phrase within the tab you're currently on.

As a note, if you search, and make a typo, you will need to clear the search bar and search again


### Tooltips ###

Scrolling over a link will provide a tooltip so you can determine if a resource might be right for you.
